    "We've studied two types of search algorithms during the recent lectures: Uninformed Search and Informed Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uninformed Search (aka blind search) refers to the search strategies that do not use additional information about states and goal of the search - nothing beyond the provided problem definition. The first algorithms that we studied from Chapter 3 of the Russel & Norvig textbook were Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) which both fall into the category of Uniformed Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also studied how we can modify DFS to combine the advantages of BFS (completeness and conditional optimality) with the main advantage of DFS --space complexity of $O(bm)$ where $b$ is the branching factor and $m$ is the maximum depth of the search space. Limited Depth Search and Iterative Deepening DFS were two algorithms that we studied in that section and you are going to use them in Part I of this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part II, you are going to practice Informed Search algorithms and heuristic functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in Part III, you will work on an example graph by applying A* and checking whether the provided heuristic is admissible and consistent or not.\n",

    "- better understand how search algorithms are implemented and work in practice. \n",
    "- practice reading documentation. This is a very important skill in AI/ML/Data Science collaborative environments and teams."
